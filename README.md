# Getting started on The Connoisseur

When working on the app we use Google's bespoke android IDE Android Studio. Download from [here](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) everything you need including the SDK.

Gradle is the 'build system of choice', it hooks up the dependencies seamlessly - you need this too ([here](https://gradle.org))

## With the system set up...

1. Create a new directory for the project
2. Clone the repo

		git clone https://github.com/tomekhotdog/The-Connoisseur.git

3. In Android Studio: File -> Import Project
4. Select the *build.gradle* file in the root of the newly cloned repository
5. Android Studio will do the rest. You may need to install some dependencies and/or restart the whole program
6. Run the app by clicking the green play button (or Run -> Run App).

You control all the dependencies via Tools -> Android -> SDK Manager. Here you can download a plethora of tools including Android Gear SDK,etc.

I would recommend using Google's magic box of tutorials and guides - its really good ([here](http://developer.android.com/index.html)). As a rule of thumb before you get used to Android, write any code in app/src/main/java
